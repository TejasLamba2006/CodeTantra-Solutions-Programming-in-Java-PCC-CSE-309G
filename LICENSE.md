# No Snitching License (NSL) v1.0 🚫👀

Yo, listen up! This is the **No Snitching License** – cuz we're all about that learning life, not the drama. You can use, copy, and vibe with the code and docs in this repo for your own educational grind. But here's the deal: **YOU CAN'T SNITCH TO THE TEACHER**. No cap.

## The Rules (Keep It 100)

1. **Use It Wisely**: This stuff is for helping you understand Java, not for straight-up copying on assignments or exams. Learn the concepts, then code like a boss.

2. **No Snitching Clause**: If you see someone using this to cheat or whatever, don't go running to the prof. We're all students here – keep it on the low. Snitching is not the move; it's sus and ruins the vibe for everyone.

3. **Share Responsibly**: You can share this repo with your squad, but tell 'em the same – no snitching, no drama. Use it to level up, not to get others in trouble.

4. **Attribution**: If you remix or use parts of this, give a shoutout. Something like "Inspired by the Java Grind Repo" keeps it real.

5. **No Warranty**: This code might have bugs (we're human, duh). Use at your own risk. If it breaks your setup, that's on you but hit us up if you need help fixing it.

## Why This License? 🤷‍♀️

Cuz education should be fun and stress-free, not a snitch fest. We're building a community of coders who help each other without the BS. If you vibe with it, cool. If not, peace out.

By using this repo, you agree to these terms. No lawyers needed – just good vibes and mutual respect.

Stay lit, stay learning! 🔥 #NoSnitch #JavaVibes
